I work at the University of Leicester as a Research Fellow in Biomedical Informatics.
This means I work with data. I also write code, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little (depending on what I use it for) and for that I use whatever is appropriate for the job: PHP, Python, R, even Java if need be.
 
In this blog I plan to post about research data-type stuff I've been doing or have done previously which I hope might be useful to other people and potentially share my experiences (good and bad).

Please get in touch if you like it (or hate it even) or if you think there are better ways of doing things.
